# Muneeb Arshad's Portfolio

This repository is to act like a high level overview of the machine learning projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` should act as a full description of the project, but I'll provide a short description here for convenience. Links are provided to projects whose code can be made public.

## Projects List

- Microscope Data Debugging Application (Private)
    - This application reads large JPEG images (e.g. 30000x30000) and loads them as shader material textures in Unity. The textures are being loaded into the GPU at           runtime. User can assign colors, zoom, pan and enable or disable a texture depending on their needs of inspection. 
    - Made using C#, Unity, Cg (Vertex and Fragment Shaders)
- [Todo App](https://mybasic-todo-app.netlify.app)
    - This is a basic React application where you can create a task in a todo list and delete it once it is done.
    - Made using React.js
- [Travel Advisor](https://travel-advisor-jsmuneeb.netlify.app/)
    - This is a React application that tells a user about local attractions, hotels and restaurants depending on the user's location.
    - Made using React.js and Firebase DB
