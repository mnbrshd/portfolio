# Machine Learning Portfolio by Muneeb Arshad

This repository is to act like a high level overview of the machine learning projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` should act as a full description of the project, but I'll provide a short description here for convenience. Links are provided to projects whose code can be made public.
